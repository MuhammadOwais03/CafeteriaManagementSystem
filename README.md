# Cafeteria-Management-System
<br>
Project Description <br>
The application will serve as a central hub for managing orders and storing important 
customer details, enhancing our operational efficiency. Moreover, it will offer customers the 
convenience of reserving tables according to their preferred time slots, streamlining the 
dining experience. The app will intelligently display the availability of dishes on our menu by 
seamlessly integrating with our cafeteria's inventory system, ensuring that customers always 
have access to up-to-date information. Additionally, it will feature a user-friendly interface to 
facilitate hassle-free payments, further elevating customer satisfaction and convenience.
The manager will have the ability to oversee all operations within the cafeteria, including 
monitoring the availability of dishes, managing inventory by adding or removing items as 
necessary, and keeping track of current reservations. This will play a pivotal role in ensuring 
smooth day-to-day operations and addressing any issues that may arise. In addition, there will 
also be a dedicated receptionist tasked with handling fundamental restaurant information. 
This includes providing incoming onsite customers with details about table availability, 
available dishes, and any other relevant information through our application, they may need 
to enhance their dining experience.<br>
